                 This is Tryhards a ...serius? guild! well
                 atleast we have fun! We have been around since the
                 launch of classic World of Warcraft and we are currently
                 clearing three Raids in one night and we have raid days and 
                 hours on Mondays and Wednesdays from 20:00 to 23:00 with invites
                 going out at 19:45 as well as a community effort to aquire World
                 buffs either 2 - 3 hours before raid or the night before a raid.
                 We have certain requierments of what consumables each class/specc 
                 should bring and use as well as helping out with guild bank for 
                 certain specific items. The most important thing to remember 
                 is that despite the name the guild is pretty laid back as long
                 as everyone pitch in and do their part of the job. If you think 
                 you have what it takes to be part of this dysfunctional family 
                 feel free to look further down the page on the recruitment section.
